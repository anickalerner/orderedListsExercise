Ordered List Exercise
Testing OrderdLists for time complexity.
The slope for O(1) graph is 0.
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList POP with nodes of type 
Run 568 tests on input sizes from 0 to 568 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList POP is -6.471830985915493
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPopOrderedList POP with nodes of type 
Run 374 tests on input sizes from 0 to 374 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList POP is 0
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList POP with nodes of type 
Run 410 tests on input sizes from 0 to 410 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList POP is -4.851219512195122
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPopOrderedList POP with nodes of type 
Run 659 tests on input sizes from 0 to 659 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList POP is -0.0015174506828528073


******************
Conclusion: POP operations with QuickPopOrderedList are clearly more effitient than PUSH operations
