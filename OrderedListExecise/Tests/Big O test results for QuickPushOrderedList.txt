Ordered List Exercise
*** Big O Tests ***
Testing OrderdLists for time complexity.
The slope for O(1) graph is 0.
The slope for O(n) graph is > 0 and constant
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList PUSH with nodes of type System.DateTime
Input lists contain 100, 1000, 10000 items
The slopes are 0, 0
The time complexity is O(1)
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList POP with nodes of type System.DateTime
Input lists contain 100, 1000, 10000 items
The slopes are 0.01, 0.13
The time complexity growth is not linear
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList PUSH with nodes of type OrderedListNovidea.Person
Input lists contain 100, 1000, 10000 items
The slopes are 0, 0
The time complexity is O(1)
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList POP with nodes of type OrderedListNovidea.Person
Input lists contain 100, 1000, 10000 items
The slopes are 0.04, 0.27
The time complexity growth is not linear

******************
Conclusion: 
    PUSH operations with QuickPushOrderedList have complexity of O(1)
    POP operations with QuickPushOrderedList
