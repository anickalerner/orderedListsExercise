Ordered List Exercise
Testing OrderdLists for time complexity.
The slope for O(1) graph is 0.
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList PUSH with nodes of type System.DateTime
Run 365 tests on input sizes from 0 to 365 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList PUSH is -0.09315068493150686
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPopOrderedList PUSH with nodes of type System.DateTime
Run 433 tests on input sizes from 0 to 433 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList PUSH is -4.20554272517321
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPushOrderedList PUSH with nodes of type OrderedListNovidea.Person
Run 560 tests on input sizes from 0 to 560 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList PUSH is -0.08571428571428572
------------------------------
Testing OrderedListNovidea.QuickPopOrderedList PUSH with nodes of type OrderedListNovidea.Person
Run 499 tests on input sizes from 0 to 499 
The slope of QuickPushOrderedList PUSH is -8.230460921843687

******************
Conclusion: PUSH operations with QuickPushOrderedList are clearly more effitient than POP operations
